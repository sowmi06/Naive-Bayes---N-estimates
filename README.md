# Naive-Bayes-N-estimates
The Naive Bayes algorithim of n- estimate version is implemented from scratch, for a classification problem. The Naive Bayes algorithim is implemented from scratch without the use of in-built library for Naive Bayes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this code is ["MONK's Problems Data Set"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK's+Problems) from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
 - The dataset has “ 432” instances.
 - The dataset has “ 6 ” features.
 - The dataset has no missing values.
 - All the attributes are categorical.
 - The classes in the dataset for classification is “0” and “1”.
 - A 70-30% split is made for testing and training data(“302” instances as train and “130” instance as test.)
  
## Results
The Naive Bayes algorithim of n- estimate version with the MONK's Problems Data Set gave the following accuracy:
 - Training Accuracy: 73.5 %
 - Testing Accuracy: 78.4 %

## Configuration Instructions
The [Project]() requires the following tools and libraries to run the source code.
### System Requirements 
- [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/install/)
    - Python version 3.6.0 – 3.9.0
 
- Python IDE (to run ".py" file)
    - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows), [Spyder](https://www.psych.mcgill.ca/labs/mogillab/anaconda2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/spyder/doc/installation.html) or [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Tools and Library Requirements 
    
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
  
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)


## Operating Instructions

The following are the steps to replicate the exact results acquired from the project:

- Satisify all the system and the tool, libraries requirements.
- Clone the [Naive-Bayes-N-estimates]() repository into your local machine. 
- Download the [Monk's Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MONK's+Problems) from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
- The [Naive_Bayes.py]() has the code for the preprocessing steps and final classifiaction output.
